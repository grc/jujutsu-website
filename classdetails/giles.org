* Giles Chamberlin: instructor at Warborough Jujutsu Club

[[file:../images/giles.jpg]]

Giles Chamberlin is the chief instructor of the Warborough jujutsu
club. Following a brief exposure to judo in the 1970's as a child, he
took up the martial arts again at Bath University in 1980.  Here he
studied judo at the university club and aikido with sensei Paul
McGlone whilst studying in Poole.

On leaving university in 1984, Giles moved to Ipswich, Suffolk where
he started training with Sterling and Roy Jerry Hobbs.  Though
concentrating mainly on Hakko Ryu, eventually attaining yondan, Giles
also studied Kamishin Ryu and was awarded nidan in that style. When
the Hobbs' left Suffolk, Giles supplemented his training with Daiwa
Ryu jujutsu under Tanaka and Harada sensei at the Herringswell branch
of the Shitenoji schools.  Together with Richard Pearman and Reg
Siger, he was given permission to teach this art by Tanaka sensei.

Giles continued to study under the tutelage of Roy Jerry Hobbs and was
awarded the grade of shihan in Dentokan Jujutsu. Since leaving the
Dentokan in 2013, Giles now concentrates on training in, and teaching,
Daiwa Ryu jujutsu. 

He has been invited to teach on seminars in the UK, as well as Berlin
and Aurich in Germany and Athens, Greece.
