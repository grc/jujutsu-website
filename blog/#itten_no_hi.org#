* Itten no hi

Itten no hi is the name given to the principle of applying a
technique with an emphasis on a single point.  That's as clear as mud.
What does it mean?

Let's start with Hakko dori as practised in Hakko Ryu.  In its
simplest form, tori grabs uke's left wrist with his right hand. Uke
now frees his hand by bringing it up as if to scratch his left ear.
That's the basic technique, but too often it degenerates into a
[[file:ukemi.org][tug of war]] as tori wrenches his hand free.

Instead of focussing on the wrist where he is being grabbed, tori
should concentrate on the tip of his little finger, visualising the
finger carving a path through the air.  This is itten no hi -
concentrating on the one point.  It sounds esoteric, but it's quite
easy and it does work.

Applying the same principle to nidangi matsuba dori, the emphasis
moves away from trying to force the 'Z' shaped lock onto uke's wrist.
Instead, the focus is upon the tip of tori's little finger, dropping
weight down through that one point.

In a variation on this principle, techniques can be applied by
focusing on a single point of uke's, rather than tori's body.  In
shodan gi, ude osae dori, uke's wrist is pinned to tori's upper arm, a
wrist lock executed and then a take down follows.  When applying the
wrist lock, concentrate on pressing a single knuckle of uke's into
your bicep.  Typically this will be the index knuckle, though it may
change depending on the grip.  This knuckle forms the one point
through which the rest of your technique is executed.

Why does it work? I don't know.  But it does for me.  The 'flavour'
of the technique seems to get sharper and control over uke more subtle
when I try to use this principle.  I was first introduced to this idea
by Tanaka Sensei of Daiwa Ryu, but the underlying principle seems to
travel happily across styles.

It's hard to get the feeling for this subtlety across in a face to
face setting on the mat.  By trying to describe it in writing on the
web I am probably setting myself an impossible task.  But I received
an email from someone asking about this - so thanks for bearing with
it so far.  Have a play with the idea and see what works for you, and
then let me know!
