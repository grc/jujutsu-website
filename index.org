* Jujutsu in Warborough

file:images/kneeling_nihonage.jpg

Warborough Jujutsu Club is a martial arts club practicing a
traditional Japanese martial art in the village of Warborough. We are
a few miles south of Oxford, just outside Wallingford - See these
[[file:classdetails/index.org][details]] for information on how to find the Warborough Jujutsu class.

The martial art of jujutsu,also spelt jujitsu, is a forerunner to
modern judo and aikido.  It has many different styles or schools.
Although each style emphasises different aspects, all share a number
of features.  The style we practice, Daiwa Ryu jujutsu is described in
this [[file:blog/traditional.org][blog]] entry.  In brief, it shares a common ancestor with Aikido
and Hakko Ryu jujutsu.

We are a small, enthusiastic group, some of whom have only recently
started training in martial arts, others have been practising for
decades.  All abilities are welcomed, but adults only.  This
particular style of jujutsu is not suitable for children.  For those
under eighteen I can recommend the [[http://www.iinkai-judo.co.uk/][Inkai Judo clubs]] --- my son used to
train with them!


There are no specific beginner classes, just come along to one of our
regular Tuesday night sessions.  Your first taster session is free, so
you have nothing to lose.  From then on sessions are Â£5.00.

If you're intending to visit I'd suggest that you drop an email to
[[mailto:giles@jujutsu.org.uk][giles@jujutsu.org.uk]] as work commitments occasionally mean the class
has to be cancelled if there is no instructor available.
