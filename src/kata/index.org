#+TITLE: Jujutsu Kata
#+SUBTITLE: A traditional martial arts club in Oxfordshire, UK.
#+DESCRIPTION: Formal technique syllabus for the Warborough jujutsu (jujitsu) club.

Daiwa Ryu jujutsu, like many traditional Japanese martial arts, is
taught in part through the repetition of a series of preset
techniques.  This is the martial art equivalent of practising your
musical scales; it's not designed to be a realistic application of the
technique, but instead to commit the details to muscle memory.  

The technique lists presented here are intended as a memory jogger for
existing students.  You won't be able to lean jujutsu just be reading
them!  They are published as PDF files for ease of reference during
training sessions.
