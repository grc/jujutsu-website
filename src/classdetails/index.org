** Travelling from the M40 and Stadhampton

Turn off at Junction 7 and take the A329 to Stadhampton.  As you
arrive in Stadhampton you will pass a petrol station on your left and
the road turns sharply right.  At this bend, turn left signposted
Warborough.  You're actually still on the A329, but it just got
narrower!

Continue on until you enter the outskirts of Warborough.  The Greet
Hall is a barn like building on your right.  If you pass St Laurence
church, you've gone too far.

Take the Oxford Road (A4074). After the petrol station and
roundabout at Benson, the next roundabout you'll come to is at
Shillingford.  Here, turn right (signposted Warborough).  The road
makes a couple of right angle turns, then takes you through the
village.  You'll pass a church on your right, the Greet Hall is the
barn like building on your left, a couple of hundred yards later.
