Warborough Jujutsu Club is a martial arts club practising a
[[file:blog/traditional.org][traditional]] Japanese martial art in the village of Warborough. We are
a few miles south of Oxford, just outside Wallingford - See these
[[file:classdetails/index.org][details]] for information on how to find the Warborough Jujutsu class.

The martial art of jujutsu, [[file:blog/jujitsu.org][also spelt jujitsu]], has a large number of
different styles or schools, known as /ryu/ in Japanese.  Our style,
Daiwa Ryu, derives from Daito Ryu which is also the precursor to
Aikido and Hakko Ryu.  Because of this common heritage, there are many
similarities in the approaches taken by these different schools,
though they tend to emphasise different aspects.  You can find more
details of the heritage in this [[file:blog/traditional.org][blog]].  Although each style emphasises
different aspects, all share a number of features.  The style we
practice, Daiwa Ryu jujutsu is described in this [[file:blog/traditional.org][blog]] entry.  In
brief, it shares a common ancestor with Aikido and Hakko Ryu jujutsu.
Other jujutsu styles, in particular the recently popular Brazilian Ju
Jitsu (BJJ), may be very different in training approach and appearance. 

We are a small, enthusiastic group, some of whom have only recently
started training in martial arts, others have been practising for
decades.  All abilities are welcomed, but adults only.  You don't need
to be particularly fit or flexible, just interested in trying
something new.  This particular style of jujutsu is not suitable for
children.  For those under eighteen I can recommend the [[http://www.iinkai-judo.co.uk/][Inkai Judo
clubs]] --- my son used to train with them!


There are no specific beginner classes, just come along to one of our
regular Tuesday night sessions.  Wear something comfortable that you
can move easily in, a T shirt and tracksuit bottoms is fine.  If you
have kit from another martial art, that is fine to wear too.  Your
first class is free, so that you can get a feel for what it is that we
do.  From then on sessions are Â£5.00 for a two hour class.

If you're intending to visit I'd suggest that you drop an email to
[[mailto:giles@jujutsu.org.uk][giles@jujutsu.org.uk]]. Work commitments occasionally mean that we have
to cancel the class as there is no instructor available.
